* **wb_prereq**: This code defines the configuration of a programme and the way it interacts with the Solana blockchain. The `WbaPrereq` type specifies the version, name, and address of the programme. The instructions it contains (for example, `complete` and `update`) define the required accounts and arguments. It also contains the account structure `Q2Prereq2024`, the error code `InvalidGithubAccount`, and the data types. This IDL provides structure and information to be used when interacting with the programme.

  We can run the script with the command `yarn wba_prereq`

* **airdrop.ts**: This code aims to transfer 2 SOLs to a wallet on the Solana blockchain. It imports the modules `Connection`, `Keypair`, and `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL`. It gets the private key of the wallet from the JSON file `wallet` and creates a `Keypair`. Solana uses a `Connection` object to connect to the devnet network. Within an anonymous asynchronous function, it requests 2 SOLs to the specified wallet with the `requestAirdrop` method. If the transaction succeeds, it provides the transaction hash and the discovery connection; otherwise it prints the error message to the console.

  we can run the code with the command `yarn airdrop `
  
<br>


* **enroll.ts**: This code is intended to send a `complete` instruction to a programme on the Solana blockchain. Imports the `Connection`, `Keypair`, and `PublicKey` modules from the `@solana/web3.js` library. Imports the `Program`, `Wallet`, and `AnchorProvider` modules from the `@coral-xyz/anchor` library. Imports `IDL` and `WbaPrereq` from the file containing the programme description. Gets the private key of the wallet from the JSON file `wallet` and creates a `Keypair`. Solana uses a `Connection` object to connect to the devnet network. It prepares the `github` data with a `Buffer`. Sets the connection and wallet with an `AnchorProvider`. Determines the account address of the programme with `findProgramAddressSync`. Sends the `complete` instruction with the `github` data in an anonymous asynchronous function. If the transaction succeeds, it provides the transaction hash and the discovery link; otherwise it prints the error message to the console.

  we can run the code with the command `yarn enroll`
  
<br>


* **keygen.ts**: This script aims to create a new Solana wallet and print its information. Imports the `Keypair` module from the `@solana/web3.js` library. Generates a new wallet (key pair) with `Keypair.generate()`. Prints the public key of the wallet with `publicKey.toBase58()` and the secret key with `secretKey` to the console. This creates a new Solana wallet and displays the key information.

  we can run the code with the command `yarn keygen`
  
<br>


* **transfer.ts**: This code aims to transfer SOL from one wallet to another on the Solana blockchain. It imports the `Transaction`, `SystemProgram`, `Connection`, `Keypair`, `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL`, `sendAndConfirmTransaction`, and `PublicKey` modules from the `@solana/web3.js` library. Gets the wallet's private key from the JSON file named `wallet` and creates a `Keypair`. Determines the public key of a second wallet. Solana uses a `Connection` object to connect to the devnet network. Within an asynchronous function, it creates a transfer transaction with the `SystemProgram.transfer` method. It signs, publishes and validates the transaction. If the transaction is successful, it provides the transaction hash and the discovery connection; otherwise it prints the error message to the console.

  we can run the code with the command `yarn transfer`
  
<br>


* **dev-wallet.json & dev-wallet2.json & dev-wallet3.json**: The files dev-wallet.json, dev-wallet2.json and dev-wallet.json are byte arrays representing the secret key of the Solana wallet. In Solana, this type of secret key is typically used to generate Keypair.

<br>

* **package.json**: Defines the project's information and dependencies.

<br>

* **package-lock.json**: Locks the exact versions and structure of dependencies, ensuring consistent installation.

<br>

* **yarn.lock** file locks the full versions of dependencies and the structures of sub-dependencies. This file ensures that the dependencies are in the same versions on every installation, thus guaranteeing that the project runs consistently in every environment.
